;;; Commentary:
;; FIXMEs
;;  - generic interface for special lists, because currently the
;;    (only) special list (buffer list) behaviour is hard coded in a
;;    way that's probably not sensible for lists like recent-files or
;;    the like
;;  - handling of invalid markers
;;    -> (don't display, quietly discard?)
;;    -> the correct while-loop which deletes invalid in
;;    mtorus-jump-current-marker or mtorus-current-buffer
;;    -> what happens when a buffer is reverted (or killed and
;;    reopened)?

;;
;;; Usage:
;;  ======
;; MTorus lets you work with several groups of buffers, each group
;; being a separate ring.  This is all for easier navigation through
;; buffers.  I've been using some buffer cycling functions on (shift
;; left and shift right) for quite a long time now and I find myself
;; cycling through larger and larger lists every day.  Starting one
;; instance of (X)Emacs for each editing context isn't the way and I
;; found no way of doing what I want with frames.  An `editing context'
;; means a logical grouping of buffers.  This could be a group for
;; quick edit of the emacs configuration files while you're actually
;; working on some (Ruby/Perl/whatever-) program or it could be all
;; the headers of your C project while all the .c-files make up
;; another group.  Whatever you can think of.  You could even make
;; different parts of your buffers (point positions) show up in
;; different groups like when one set of functions spread throughout
;; one (or more) files is responsible for one specific task or like
;; working on a chapter in a LaTeX-document while defining some macros
;; at the top of the file.  There is always a default group which
;; contains all the open buffers and can not be altered.
;;
;; Like so:

;; Choosing another entry in such a group is done by actually cycling
;; through the group (like with e.g. the kill-ring) and since the
;; entries are made of a buffer together with a position (and that is a
;; marker) each of the groups is comparable to the mark-ring.  And
;; since we are cycling through a collection of those rings we are
;; using a Torus here.  Hence the name: "mtorus": mark-torus.
;; (A "group" will usually be referred to as a "ring" from now.)

;;; History
;; Just as many other people I have once (co-)written a buffer cycling
;; mechanism, that was later expanded to using a skipping
;; predicate.  At some point it wasn't enough anymore and I still had
;; the question nagging: what could I possible do with Shift Up and
;; Down? Then I discovered that I often used several buffers in one
;; context (and they were not neighbors on the buffer-list).  This made
;; me think of groups of buffers and led to a first implementation
;; under the name "session-stack.el".  Then it occurred to me that I
;; wanted to navigate different positions in the same buffer with it
;; and expanded the code.  Sometimes I wondered that those hotspots
;; seemed to move around until I read a chapter about markers in the
;; elisp info file and suddenly I understood that the points I stored
;; were not moving together with the text.  During that rewrite I
;; renamed the whole thing to mtorus reflecting the topology of the
;; main data structure.  All this happened during autumn and winter of
;; 2002.  In early 2003 I came across swbuff.el which had a very nice
;; popup window feature that I definetely admired and wanted to
;; have.  It became clear that a full rewrite had to be done once again
;; because the code (which was then just released to the public one
;; week ago) had become quite a mess.  The time of this writing is
;; right during that rewrite.  Why I tell this all here? Hm, probably
;; mainly for myself to remember when I'm grey and old (and still be
;; using XEmacs ;-)
